The title is still a work in progress.

We need a wiki that is powered by org-mode documents on disk or in a git
repository.

Org-mode offers a lot of power over Markdown and thus is a more desirable
format. One example is org-babel.

We want to invite authors who are less-technical than software engineers. As
such, the git management should be fairly streamlined if at all possible.
Initial iterations will not cover this though, and will defer to other systems.
